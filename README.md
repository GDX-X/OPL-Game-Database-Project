# About the database

- 
### About Title
- Each region has its own game title
- (Note that not all game titles are translated)

### About Release Date
- Each region has its own release date and each month and translated

### About Descriptions
- Each description is translated into its own languages. NOTE if the descriptions are in English for a different language, it means there are no descriptions in that language, so by default English will be used.

- The maximum length allowed for game descriptions in Open PS2 Loader is 255 characters. Descriptions on ScreenScraper.fr are longer than that, so they have been shortened in the following way:
- The text was truncated to 255 characters. Since the truncated text might have hanging sentences, the resulting text is further trimmed to the last period.
